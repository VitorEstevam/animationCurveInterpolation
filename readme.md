# Interpolate anything using animation curves with just a few lines üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è

# why polarca?

## Polarca is the simplest way to use animation curves to interpolate values in game maker studio 2
### you just need to create some polarca_animation instances and run it:

     //create
     xa = new polarca_animation("x",x+400,ac,0,0.005)
     polarca_animation_start([xa])

### With this lib you can also create sequential animation in the simplest way ever! Just pass some arrays of arrays and see the magic happening:

     //create
     ya = new polarca_animation("image_yscale",8,ac1,1,0.005)
     xa = new polarca_animation("image_xscale",8,ac1,0,0.005)
     polarca_sequence_start([
     [ya],
     [xa]
     ])
